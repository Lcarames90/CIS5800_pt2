# CIS5800_pt2
Property Management System with 'package tracking functionalities', 'maintenance requests', login featurettes etc

This program was created by following Miguel Grinberg's 'The Flask Mega-Tutorial'
The program has be been modified with slight adjustments for an internal 'Property Management System'.
The program will be presented for CIS 5800 GROUP 1 - Project Management for Software-Development & other technology adjacent catagories

Up until December 4th, 2022 I was following chapter by chapter to take in the material thoroughly but with a large influx of deadlines approaching and a critical bug that I could not overcome efficiently, I made the decision to reach directly from Miguel's source code to expedite code etc.

I DO NOT claim this application to be my own or an entirely original intellectual creation and for osterity, credit and thank Miguel Grinberg for the endlessly interesting material and thoroughness for writing the Mega-Flask Tutorial.

HOWEVER, my vision to modify this application into an internal 'Property Management System' in accordance with CIS 5800's project scope, is my idea.
